# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is like teaching a computer to learn from
experience, just like how humans learn. Imagine we want to teach a child
to recognize apples. We show them many pictures of apples and tell them,
“This is an apple.” Over time, the child becomes good at spotting apples
because they’ve learned from all the examples we have shown.

In machine learning, we do the same thing with computers. We feed them
lots of data (like pictures of apples) and tell them what it is. Over
time, the computer “learns” patterns from the data, and eventually, it
can make predictions or recognize things on its own.

For example, if we show it a new picture of fruit, it can say, “That’s
an apple” without us telling it. The more data the computer sees, the
better it gets at learning, just like a person practicing a skill.

The key thing is that the computer isn’t given exact instructions on how
to do something. Instead, it figures it out by looking at lots of
examples!

Machine learning can be divided into different types based on how the
computer learns from the data. The two main types are **supervised
learning** and **unsupervised learning**, and here’s an easy way to
understand them:
